The weather app is a sophisticated creation powered by Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It harnesses the capabilities of the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, presenting users with accurate and up-to-date information. The app goes beyond traditional weather applications by automatically updating its background to reflect the current weather conditions. This dynamic feature is achieved through the use of API-provided codes.
